# AIMI port - state of play, and where to start next

Updated 2026-09-02, on `kmp-aimi-migration-study` at `1f6ca62fe8` (the second `kmp` merge).
**Read this first.** It supersedes the stale parts of the older documents in this folder; each of
those is marked below with what to still trust it for.

Tree is clean. `:app:assembleFullDebug` EXIT=0. `:plugins:aps:compileKotlinIosArm64` EXIT=0.
`:plugins:aps:testAndroidHostTest` **330 tests, 0 failures**. `:ios:shell:checkMigratedModules` EXIT=0.

## 1. The two-line summary

`DetermineBasalAIMI2` is **2 files away** from compiling in `commonMain`. Upstream has meanwhile
shipped a real, working **iOS follower app** - which changes the strategic picture more than it
changes our remaining work.

---

## 2. What is done

| lot | commit | what |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `77099513a5` | made the branch build again after the first merge (4 defects) |
| 1 | `eaa3453fc3` | 3 files + `AdvisorModels` to commonMain |
| 2 | `b7354d4a85` | **the `AimiStorage` seam** + 6 files |
| 3 | `0f23dc3a5f` | **restored 389 LOC** an earlier port had silently dropped |
| 4A | `7852c8a923` | `aimiNeuralNetwork.kt` to commonMain |
| 4B | `fb7bcc9a57` | `BasalNeuralLearner` to commonMain |
| — | `1f6ca62fe8` | merged 246 upstream commits |

AIMI in `commonMain`: **333 files**. Tests went from **0 runnable** to **330 green**.

Verification standard used on every lot, and worth keeping: the numeric-literal multiset of each
moved file is diffed against **two** baselines - the `dev_OAPSAIMI` reference for logic, and the
immediately preceding state for the effect of the lot. Every lot so far: zero delta. That is the only
check that has actually caught things.

---

## 3. The last two blockers, and the pattern to use

`DetermineBasalAIMI2` imports 212 `plugins.aps` symbols. 195 resolve in `commonMain`. **Two files**
remain in `androidMain`:

- `openAPSAIMI/utils/AimiStorageHelper.kt`
- `openAPSAIMI/physio/AimiHormonitorStudyExporterMTR.kt` (`HormonitorDecisionEventMTR` is declared
  inside it at line 47 - not a third blocker)

**Do not invent a seam for these.** Upstream added exactly the pattern they need, in this same
module, in commit `f06619c50d`:

```
plugins/aps/src/commonMain/.../loop/LoopNotifier.kt      <- the interface
plugins/aps/src/androidMain/.../loop/AndroidLoopNotifier.kt
plugins/aps/src/iosMain/.../loop/IosLoopNotifier.kt
plugins/aps/src/iosTest/.../loop/IosLoopNotifierTest.kt  <- and it is tested
desktop/shell/.../platform/DesktopLoopNotifier.kt        <- four platforms now
```

Copy that shape. `AimiStorageHelper` is the Android implementation behind the `AimiStorage` seam we
already built in lot 2, so the work is to **rewire its consumers to `AimiStorage`**, not to move it.
`AimiStorageHelper` should stay in `androidMain` forever.

`AimiHormonitorStudyExporterMTR` needs six seams: `MessageDigest`, `SimpleDateFormat`, `Settings`,
`SystemClock`, `TimeZone`, `AtomicLong`. It deserves its own lot, and it is optional surface - a
study exporter, not a dosing path. **Consider deferring it and porting `DetermineBasalAIMI2` with
that one import stubbed**, rather than paying six seams first.

---

## 4. Three hazards, ranked

**H1 - `plugins/aps` lost its Metro Dagger interop.** Green today, because nothing in the module
carries a javax annotation any more. But the parked `OpenAPSAIMIPlugin.kt` has
`javax.inject.Provider` at line 104 and an `@Inject constructor` at line 151. The moment it lands,
Metro skips those declarations and `:app` fails with `UnprocessedUpstreamDeclaration`.
**Convert `OpenAPSAIMIPlugin` to `dev.zacsweers.metro` before porting it, not after.**

**H2 - our `plugins/source` interop block is the last one in the repo.** Upstream has removed
`includeDagger()` from every module; ours is fork-only, and it is holding up **7** files (the Dexcom
ONE+ and Libre 3 activities). Its own comment says 14, which was wrong - correct it when touched. It
sits in a file upstream edits often, so it is a standing conflict, and it dies outright if upstream
drops the interop capability. Converting those 7 files to Metro removes the dependency.

**H3 - the fork's CGM floor keeps rising under it.** `AbstractBgSourcePlugin` and
`AbstractBgSourceWithSensorInsertLogPlugin` moved to `commonMain`, and `DexcomOnePlusPlugin` /
`Libre3NativePlugin` sit on them. Meanwhile `:plugins:dexcom_oneplus` (76 files),
`:plugins:libre3` (147) and `:plugins:libkeks` (29) are still plain `android.library` applying
`android-module-dependencies` and `test-module-dependencies` - convention plugins that the
`kmp-module-flip` skill states **cannot** be used by a multiplatform module. These three will have to
flip eventually, and nobody has started.

**After every merge that touches DI, purge the generated output before believing the build.** This
has now bitten twice, identically. Upstream keeps deleting Dagger and Hilt code, but
`build/generated/ksp/**` still holds Java that imports `dagger.hilt.InstallIn` and `dagger.android`,
and it fails `compileFullDebugJavaWithJavac` in `:app` and in several `:pump:*` modules. The Kotlin
compile and the tests pass, so it looks like an unrelated breakage. The fix is one line:

```
find . -type d -name ksp -path "*/build/generated/*" -exec rm -rf {} +
```

A related trap, also hit twice: `./gradlew … > log 2>&1; echo "EXIT=$?"` in a **backgrounded** command
reports the exit code of the `echo`, not Gradle's, and the harness notification then says "exit code
0" over a failed build. Append the real code into the log (`echo "GRADLE_EXIT=$?" >> log`) and read it
from there.

Two smaller ones: `plugins/aps/androidMain/AndroidManifest.xml` was **deleted** upstream, so
`StepService.kt` needs `:app` now. And the iOS/desktop guards fail only the iOS/desktop build, so
**drift is invisible from an Android-only local build** - run `:ios:shell:checkMigratedModules`
before believing a green tree.

## 5. What upstream shipped, and why it matters strategically

246 commits, 2026-08-28 to 09-01: KMP-ification 64, **iOS client 36**, **desktop/JVM client 29**,
Dagger/Hilt → Metro 24, maintenance 19, tests 13, docs 10. 193 files newly in `commonMain`.
`:plugins:sync` (216 files) and `:shared:tests` flipped.

**The iOS app is real.** `ios/app/AAPSClient.xcodeproj` has 8 native targets and two products;
`ClientApp.swift` is a 50-line `@main` that hands off to `AapsAppHostKt.aapsAppViewController`;
`ios/shell` holds 28 `iosMain` files and 12 `iosTest`, links a static `AapsShared` framework, and
hosts the **real** `AapsAppRoot` from `appshell/commonMain` - not stubs. There is also a runnable
desktop client.

**But it is a follower, deliberately.** `ios/shell/.../config/IosClientConfig.kt`:

```
override val APS: Boolean = false
override val PUMPCONTROL: Boolean = false
override val PUMPDRIVERS: Boolean = false
override val AAPSCLIENT: Boolean = true
```

with the KDoc *"does not run the loop, which is exactly what `AAPSCLIENT` means… This is a real
implementation, not a stand-in."* The "two iOS clients" are the `aapsclient` / `aapsclient2`
flavours, **not** the `full` flavour AIMI runs on.

So: **scenario SC-A of the original study has essentially been delivered by upstream, and SC-C
(a master on iPhone) is untouched.** Nothing upstream has done makes the loop, the pump drivers or
the background execution problem any closer. The recommendation to ship the *engine* rather than
rebuild the *app* stands, and is now better supported: the shared spine below the UI exists, is
tested on Native, and someone else maintains it.

## 6. Corrections to the older documents in this folder

**There is a second, larger body of planning in this folder that post-dates the study:**
`AIMI_KMP_MIGRATION_BLUEPRINT.md` with annexes 5-9 and `AIMI_KMP_IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md`. Where it
disagrees with the study, it is generally right, because it read the code rather than the counts. The
clearest case is the ML runtime: annex 5 records that `modelUAM.tflite` is 4,504 bytes with an
`[1,18]` Float32 input and one live inference in `DetermineBasalAIMI2`, and that `AimiNeuralNetwork`
has a **different architecture**. So the study's idea of re-expressing the model as
`AimiNeuralNetwork` JSON was not a like-for-like swap - it would have changed behaviour on an SMB
estimation path. **Keep the model; run it through a per-platform adapter.** That raises the cost
rather than lowering it, and it means TFLite does not simply disappear from the iOS story.

`AIMI_KMP_MIGRATION_STUDY.md` - still the right strategic frame (SC-A/B/C/D, the tier analysis, the
distribution and Critical Alerts findings). **Three further claims in it are now false:**

1. *"There is no iOS app at all: no `iosApp/`, no `.xcodeproj`, no XCFramework."* Wrong since
   2026-08-29. See §5.
2. *"A module's conversion cost is roughly its Dagger count."* Retired. Upstream replaced Dagger with
   **Metro**, which is KMP-native; Dagger is down from 1,053 files to a remnant. The §7 line item for
   Dagger de-wiring and the SC-C repo-wide DI swap (12-20 pw) should both be re-costed downward.
3. *"Room is untouched."* `:database:impl` and `:database:persistence` are both in `migratedModules`
   now.

`CURSOR_SESSION_REVIEW.md` - the process findings hold (the four-copy problem, the honesty of the
ledger, the "clean imports because the hard half was parked" reading). Its **zero `expect`/`actual`**
observation is no longer true of the tree as a whole - upstream now has real ones, and
`LoopNotifier` shows the shape.

`AIMI_PORT_VERIFICATION.md` - the checklist results were true at `c174fa6f69`. Re-run the
`kmp-module-flip` checks after any lot; the two that mattered (the plugin is not registered, the port
is not wired into the app) are **still true**.

---

## 7. Start here tomorrow

1. **Convert `OpenAPSAIMIPlugin.kt` (parked) off javax to Metro.** H1. Do this before any port
   touches it.
2. **Lot 5: rewire `AimiStorageHelper`'s consumers to `AimiStorage`.** The seam exists; this removes
   blocker one without moving the file.
3. **Decide on `AimiHormonitorStudyExporterMTR`**: six seams, or stub the import and press on to
   `DetermineBasalAIMI2`. Recommend the stub - it is a study exporter, not a dosing path.
4. **Then `DetermineBasalAIMI2` itself.** 18,886 lines, of which only **244 touch Android**: 133
   `context.getString`, 116 `JSONObject`, 107 `Locale.US` with 33 `String.format`, 26 atomics. The
   `aimiFmt1` seam (lot 1), the `AimiStorage` seam (lot 2) and `AapsLock` already cover part of that
   list. Note upstream **dropped its own `org.json` port** in `eb6f17f494` - check what it did
   instead before writing 116 conversions by hand.
5. **Keep the two-baseline numeric check on every lot.** It is cheap and it is the only gate that has
   caught anything.

One process note for whoever runs the next session: the pipeline of five agents (definer, designer,
coder, controller, committer) earned its cost. In every lot, a later stage caught a real error an
earlier stage had missed - a spec that claimed no `String.format` where there were four, a dependency
closure naming the wrong companions, a "mechanical" swap that would have loaded a forever-growing CSV
into memory on every loop tick. A single pass would have shipped each of those.
