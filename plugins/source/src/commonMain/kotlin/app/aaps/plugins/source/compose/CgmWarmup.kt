 * with this one enum and each driver maps its own onto it on Android.
 *
 * The generic [app.aaps.core.interfaces.source.CgmWarmupStatus] cannot carry this: by contract it
 * is null once the wait is over, so it has no IDLE, READY or FAILED, and these screens have to tell
 * those three apart - they pick the colour of the chip, they stop the countdown, and they clear the
 * local fallback timer.
